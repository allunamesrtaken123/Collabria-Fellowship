This repository contains the Python scripts to run the simulations described in the paper "Factors in Learning Dynamics Influencing Relative Strengths of Strategies in Poker Simulation". Also included is a zip file of the results. Take care unzipping, as it is about thirty five gigabytes.

For the paper, holistic learning corresponds to weighted linear learning and win oriented learning corresponds to non-linear weighted learning.
