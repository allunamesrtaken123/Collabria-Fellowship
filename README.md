This repository contains the Python scripts to run the simulations described in the paper "Factors in Learning Dynamics Influencing Relative Strengths of Strategies in Poker Simulation". The zip files are too big to upload to the repository, but if you would like the data or are interested in the project shoot me an email (aaronfoote31@gmail.com).

For the paper, holistic learning corresponds to weighted linear learning and win oriented learning corresponds to non-linear weighted learning.
